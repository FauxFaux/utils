=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<gptrans_conv> [options] [file [files [...]]]

B<gptrans_conv> -S [options] [file [files [...]]]

B<gptrans_conv> -u [options] [file [files [...]]]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Converts between various GPS formats.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<--chronology>

Check for broken chronology, warn about entries with an old timestamp.

=item B<-d>, B<--skip-dups>

Skip duplicated coordinates.

=item B<-e>, B<--epoch>

Use seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 GMT as date format.

item B<--fix>

Comment out entries which is obviously wrong. Use together with 
--chronology to fix those kind of errors. Does not work with GPX output 
yet.

=item B<-h>, B<--help>

Show this help.

=item B<--inside>

Print only trackpoints inside a rectangle specified by --pos1 and 
--pos2.

=item B<--near>

Add names of the three closest waypoints to the trackpoint. Unfinished 
and experimental, needs gpsbabel.

=item B<-n>, B<--undefined x>

Use x as undefined value.

=item B<-o>, B<--output-format x>

Use output format x:

=over 4

=over 4

=item clean

=item csv

=item gpsml (Default)

This is the format which is meant to be used when storing the track 
logs.
It is line-based XML which makes it easy to edit and grep. Probably not 
finished yet.

=item gpstrans

=item gpx (Not complete)

=item poscount

Creates a 3D plot where areas with many trackpoints are higher than 
areas with less track points.

=item ps (Unfinished)

=item svg (Unfinished)

=item xgraph

=item ygraph

=back

=back

Z<>

=item B<--outside>

Print only trackpoints outside a rectangle specified by --pos1 and 
--pos2.

=item B<--pos1 x>
=item B<--pos2 x>

Specifies corners of an area rectangle used by the --inside and 
--outside options. The x value is in "lat,lon" format (decimal degrees, 
negative for west or south) .

=item B<-r>, B<--require x>

Specify requirements for trackpoints to be written. x is a string with 
the following flags:

=over 4

=over 4

=item e

=over 4

=item Print only waypoints which have an elevation.

=back

=back

=over 4

=item p

=over 4

=item Print only waypoints which have a position.

=item t

=over 4

=item Print only waypoints which have a timestamp.

=back

=back

=back

Z<>

=item B<-R>, B<--round x=y[,x2=y2[...]]>

Round trackpoint element x to y decimals.

Example:

 --round lat=4,lon=5,ele=1

=item B<-s>, B<--short-date>

Use short date format.

=item B<-S>, B<--save-to-file x>

Save the unconverted data to a file with a filename starting with the 
timestamp of the first trackpoint. The parameter string x is added at 
the end of the filename. For the time being this option will ignore all 
other options.

Note: If several files are specified on the command line, all data will 
be saved into only one file. This behaviour may change in the future.

=item B<-t>, B<--create-breaks>

Create breaks in track between points with a difference more than the 
number of seconds specified by the C<$PAUSE_LIMIT> variable.

=item B<-u>, B<--comment-out-dups>

Comment out following data with identical position values, only print 
first entry.

=item B<-v>, B<--verbose>

Verbose output.

=item B<-w>, B<--strip-whitespace>

Strip all unnecessary whitespace.

=item B<-y>, B<--double-y-scale>

Double Y scale (latitude) to get it right in gnuplot.

=item B<-h>, B<--help>

Print a brief help summary.

=item B<--version>

Print version information.

=item B<--debug>

Print debugging messages.

=back

=head1 BUGS

Pretty incomplete in some areas. Some of the source formats are 
undocumented and thus incomplete. Some functionality is not working 
properly, for example the Postscript output.
