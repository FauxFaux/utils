.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fB\-\-chronology\fR
.RS 4
Check for broken chronology, warn about entries with an old timestamp.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-skip\-dups\fR
.RS 4
If succeeding identical coordinates are found, print only the first one and ignore the rest.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-epoch\fR
.RS 4
Use seconds since 1970\-01\-01 00:00:00 GMT as date format.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-fix\fR
.RS 4
Comment out entries which is obviously wrong. Use together with
\fB\-\-chronology\fR
to fix those kind of errors. Does not work with GPX output yet.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-from\-date \fR\fB\fIx\fR\fR
.RS 4
Used by the
pgwupd
format. Specifies from which date waypoints should be updated. No checks for valid date format here, let
PostgreSQL
take care of that. All variants it understands can be used here.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
.RS 4
Send a brief help summary to stdout.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-inside\fR
.RS 4
Print only trackpoints inside a rectangle specified by
\fB\-\-pos1\fR
and
\fB\-\-pos2\fR.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-undefined \fR\fB\fIx\fR\fR
.RS 4
Use
\fIx\fR
as undefined value.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-near\fR
.RS 4
Add names of the three closest waypoints to the trackpoint. Unfinished and experimental, needs
\fBgpsbabel\fR(1), which is called from the program as
\fB/usr/local/bin/gpsbabel\fR.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-output\-format \fR\fB\fIx\fR\fR
.RS 4
Use output format
\fIx\fR:
.RS 4
.PP
\fBclean\fR
.RS 4
TAB\-separated format with longitude, latitude and altitude.
.RE
.PP
\fBcsv\fR
.RS 4
TAB\-separated format:
.RS 4
.PP

Date of trackpoint. Format:
\fIyyyy\fR\-\fImm\fR\-\fIdd\fRT\fIhh\fR:\fImm\fR:\fIss\fRZ

\fB\-\-epoch\fR
option is specified. If so, it\(cqs represented as number of seconds since 1970\-01\-01 00:00:00 UTC.
.RE
.PP
longitude
.RS 4
Longitude, decimal degrees.
.RE
.PP
latitude
.RS 4
Latitude, decimal degrees.
.RE
.PP
altitude
.RS 4
Altitude in metres above sea level. Optional. If not present, the corresponding TAB is also printed, to keep the number of columns intact.
.RE
.RE
.RE
.PP
\fBgpsml\fR (Default)
.RS 4
Line\-based XML which makes it easy to edit and grep. In the past, there was this big plan about making this the default storage format, so it was declared as The Honourable Default Output Format. But using GPX is the way to go, so this will probably change in the future. It\(cqs way too
de facto
and widely used, so storing GPS data in anything else is sheer waste of work. Probably not finished yet.
.RE
.PP
\fBgpstrans\fR
.RS 4
The format generated by
\fBgpstrans\fR(1).
.RE
.PP
\fBgpx\fR
.RS 4

.TP 4
\(bu
Pretty incomplete in some areas. Some of the source formats are undocumented and thus incomplete. Some functionality is not working properly, for example the Postscript output.
.TP 4
\(bu
Remove hardcodings, for example the
\(lqhome\(rq
position used to calculate the
avst
database column.
.TP 4
\(bu
Translate database column names to English.
.TP 4
\(bu
Add more tests to cover all command\-line options.
